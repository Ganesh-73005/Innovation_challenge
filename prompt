with given data , try to simulate among multiple dealerships in db (mongo db) implement below: customer enters his service query through images, text, voice : then the problem is matched against top k problems in database and learn the detailed description and ask followup qns from customer to find the correct one problem and give estimated cost(parts+labour) and estimated time and displayed in map for multiple dealership using their datas and then allow them to choos etheir prefering dealership for service this is all about customer facing , in this i need rag pipeline for retrieving the matched problems and resective functionalities , for image +text based inputs please use gemini api call which understand the image and give expected problems and that is matched using rag pipleline and db and followup qns etc.... process. at last of prompt voice to text, api call code i gave for building agents. For service side you need to have scheduled appointments and labour , cost , parts details in detail and have approve or edit option for modification and status is returened to customer. the edit option in serivce side should be javing interface to choose service options an dparts options from database and automatic cost calculation and bay and labour arranngement. use reacct for frontend , python (langflow, etc... for agents creation and coordination) , java springboot for rules engine for warranaty or insurance claims .....from groq import Groq client = Groq() completion = client.chat.completions.create( model="openai/gpt-oss-120b", messages=[ { "role": "user", "content": "" } ], temperature=1, max_completion_tokens=8192, top_p=1, reasoning_effort="medium", stream=True, stop=None ) for chunk in completion: print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content or "", end="") Copy import os from groq import Groq client = Groq() filename = os.path.dirname(__file__) + "/audio.m4a" with open(filename, "rb") as file: transcription = client.audio.transcriptions.create( file=(filename, file.read()), model="whisper-large-v3", temperature=0, response_format="verbose_json", ) print(transcription.text) import google.generativeai as genai import PIL.Image import os # 1. Setup your API Key # Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual key from https://aistudio.google.com/ os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_API_KEY" genai.configure(api_key=os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"]) # 2. Initialize the model # Use 'gemini-1.5-flash' for speed or 'gemini-1.5-pro' for complex reasoning model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash') # 3. Load your image # Make sure the image file is in the same folder or provide a full path img = PIL.Image.open('image.jpg') # 4. Make the API Call # You pass a list containing both the prompt string and the image object response = model.generate_content([ "Explain what is happening in this image and identify any objects you see.", img ]) # 5. Print the result print("-" * 30) print(response.text) print("-" * 30)
